My personal website and utility collection for CSEDU students.

## Overview

This repository contains my GitHub Pages website that hosts various educational tools and utilities, primarily designed for Computer Science and Engineering students at the University of Dhaka (CSEDU), particularly the 28th batch.

## Features

### ðŸ§® [CGPA Calculator](/cgpa)
A comprehensive CGPA calculator built with React that helps students calculate their cumulative grade point average. Features include:
- Support for theory and lab subjects
- Previous CGPA integration
- Real-time calculation
- Mobile-responsive design

### ðŸ“… [CSEDU28 Class Routine](/routine)
Dynamic class routine display using FullCalendar library, synchronized with a Google Calendar that I maintain for the CSEDU 28th batch class schedule.
